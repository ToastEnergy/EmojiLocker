# Emoji Locker

A simple [Discord](https://discord.com) bot with the purpose of permitting the usage of a Discord API's feature not included in the official clients, restricting emojis' usage using a role whitelist.


This was one of my first projects, it was started in 2019 and it's currently being rewritten using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library
